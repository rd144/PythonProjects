Meal Planner is a python based class that will allow a user to plan their meals for a given week by utilising recipes
stored within a JSON file.

It is designed to be used in conjunction with a Kivy front end and another funtion "Recipe Manager" to allow a user to
add, modify, and remove recipes.

Future scope increase include:
    Generate Shopping list
    Provide suggested recipes like:
        Other recipes to shrink the number of items on your list
        Recipes based on existing Ingredients to limit food waste
        Meals that haven't been eaten in a while
