The Aim of this project is to create two functions. One that can create Sudoku problems of a given difficulty, and
one that can solve them.

For the first part this should be achieved by using the logical basis of sudoku. I suspect the hardest part of the
start will be defining and attaining set difficulties.

For the second part, use a large dataset of problems defined by the first part to train a neural Network AI that can
solve any sudoku puzzle it's given

A possible 3rd part would be to use pygame to create a display to present the problem and the NN solving it in real time

Approach:

Find some empty space
Attempt to place the digits 1-n in that space
Check if that digit is valid in the current spot based on the current board
 a. If the digit is valid, recursively attempt to fill the board using steps 1-3.
 b. If it is not valid, reset the square you just filled and go back to the previous step.
Once the board is full by the definition of this algorithm we have found a solution.
