                    cider. We men got that new house up and&#13;\ntight in a day, and I did a lot of the inside
                    woodwork, including the&#13;\nbed frames. It felt good to be doing what I loved best for once, being&#13;\na

                    We didn\xe2\x80\x99t&#13;\ntrust the banks any more than Henry did, so we bought land instead. I&#13;\ndid
                    really well for almost a year, and then some newspaper reporter&#13;\nwrote that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t

                    evening, being a Saturday, Dorothy did her wire walk over the&#13;\npigsty. Ozamandia played a flute
                    as Dorothy performed, and though you&#13;\nprobably won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, the sow and piglets
                    got up on their hind&#13;\ntrotters and danced.

                    months. Sell Mother\xe2\x80\x99s&#13;\nhouse for me and you keep half. Start that woodworking
                    business for&#13;\nreal this time. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever really
                    loved. I\xe2\x80\x99ll&#13;\nwrite and tell you where to send my portion when I know.\xe2\x80\x9d
