   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome!
========

Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to look at some of my code. I hope it aids or inspires you.

Here you can find a list of all the projects I have pushed to my master branch, with documentation on their intention
and their usage. I intend to make this documentaion more verbose as I add projects and refine both my code base and my
skills. Any and all feedback is welcome at rossdpython@gmail.com.

Thanks,

Ross
